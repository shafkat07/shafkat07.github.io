Describe the web-application you intend to build (in detail please!)

I along with my group intend to build a backend side of a coffee shop. Professor Dan Port handed out three real life projects about a coffee shop, Morning Brew Merchandise. We chose to do the backend side while a different group chose the frontend. The backend side mainly consist of users getting and managing the orders by customers. When someone orders something, someone from the other side like cashier or a barista will receive the order and start processing it. 

Indicate how you expect the application will make use of the required technical complexity items (e.g. file I/O, sessions, multi-dimensional arrays, etc.)

Through a form a customer will send an order to the other end, while it will gather in a database. It will pop up on the receiving end where a barista will log in with their credentials and start processing it. I will use sessions, so a barista doesn’t have to worry about logging in frequently.

What is your plan to ensure you successfully complete your project before the end of the semester?

I am definitely going to consult my professors this time, so I end the project before the deadline. I am using PHP instead of JS which will be a great issue for me. For this reason I will sketch out the codes first and proof read it by my professors. 

What progress have you made so far and what is left for you to do?

I already created a demo frontend to support my backend. Already created a form so a user can punch in their request. The current problem I am facing right now is not getting the responses in my database i.e the customer’s orders aren’t showing up. I will consult some experts regarding it.

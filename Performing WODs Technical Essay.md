  WOD BrowserHistory 6 is continues from browser history 3, where one main page splits into 4 different ones containing history of Chrome, Firefox, IE and introduction. Moreover, it introduces three buttons in the homepage linked to those 3 pages. Mouse moves over a button, it displays the corresponding browser icon in the area below the buttons.

The overall experience was complicated than the previous ones. This one took me much more time to understand and then process. I had to go back and forth to watch the video for certain lines. After making the 3 new pages, linking them to the homepage was the main challenge. It was a lot of coding on the index page to add the other pages in it. Even though it was a copy and pasting sometimes, I was missing out some minor symbols. So every time I reloaded pages I couldn’t find the fault in the page until I realized it was something minor. I managed to learn that through webpage inspections then console. 

I read the instructions and verified with the video to check if I understood properly or not. The readings were bit complicated, but I still read it. With the previous ones, I at one point gave up and synced with the tutorial video. I don’t have any knowledge for coding so that helped me a lot to understand the basics. 

I want to have more patience than anything else. Since coding is totally a new world for me so that made me very impatient to stick around. I skipped some reading in between which I want to go back and finish in time before I reach for something bigger.

Assignment 1 is mainly purposed for basic HTML web page building.  I personally enjoyed working on this assignment even though I didn’t figure out what I want to do until the night before of the deadline. My challenges were working on the invoice page linking to the main products page, generating a confirmation page and finally server-side processing. 

The overall experience was complicated, but I enjoyed it. This one took me much more time to understand and then process compared to the WODs. I had to go back and forth to Browser History 3 from which I borrowed the codes. Speaking of borrowing, I didn’t know how to comment on the page which I had to learn by watching another people’s work. After successfully making the index and the main products pages, linking it to the invoice page was the main challenge. I followed word to word for the invoice page from the invoice WOD and smart phone product lab, but there was a glitch somewhere along the line which was not visible on my eye. Since I started the assignment on the last day, there was already a rush. So I had to submit the assignment just like the way it was to ensure the deadline. I wish I had started it earlier and took my problems to my professors during class time. Designing the page was something I enjoyed the most. Starting from changing the color to image resizing, all of them were helpful to build my own website. I was always missing out minor symbols in editing the JS scripts; that issue has been continuing since doing the WODs. 

Previously I didn’t have knowledge on HTML webpage coding, but after this assignment I’d say I took some ideas in my bunch. Thanks to the examples provided in the assignment page, which helped me a lot to reach the goal of the assignment. Even though, lab 13 gave an idea about server-side processing, I was still lost. So, the server.js file in the example assignments gave me an idea of defining the role of the server in the assignment. Due to spending excessive time on the server page, I lost control over the invoice page and was unable to link that page to the main page. I feel there were some very minor errors in that page for which the assignment remains incomplete but for the sake of deadline I had to submit it. 

For assignment 2 I want to give it a head start from a week so unlike last time I am not lost in similar situation like “unable to GET: invoice.” It will also give me time to pay a visit to my professors in case there are some errors as I am serious in getting full credit for the next assignment.
